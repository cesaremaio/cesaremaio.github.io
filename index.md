## 🧠 About Me

I'm a physicist with a deep interest in the structure of complex phenomena and their mathematical modelling. I hold a **Master’s Degree in Physics of Complex Systems (110/110 cum laude)** from the University of Torino and completed my **Master’s thesis on Multitask Learning** at **KU Leuven**, collaborating with an international research group.

Currently, I’m an intern at **Italdesign Giugiaro**, working on:
- 🧠 LLM-based solutions using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- 🔁 Data pipelines for crawling, preprocessing, and vector database ingestion
- ⚙️ Scalable and modular backend systems powered by **FastAPI**

I enjoy building elegant, efficient, and well-documented AI systems that bridge research and real-world needs.
